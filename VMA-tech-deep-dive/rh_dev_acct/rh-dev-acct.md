# Create a Red Hat Developer account

The **ETX Virtualization Delivery** workshop requires every attendee to have a
Red Hat account in order to access certain Red Hat software.  It is strongly
recommended that all attendees create a Red Hat developer account for use
during the workshop.  This is true even for attendees that have one or more
existing Red Hat accounts.

If desired, a service such as [GMail](https://gmail.com) can be used to create a new (possibly
temporary) email address to avoid interfering with any existing Red Hat logins.

1. Navigate to https://developer.redhat.com.

1. Click on the **Join Red Hat Developer** button.

   credentials can be used during the workshop when a Red Hat login is required.
